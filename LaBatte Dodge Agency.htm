			to Hannah Hopkins, the daughter of the Reverend Samuel Hopkins. Solon had been operating a pool hall and lunch
			room in block 4 on main street at the time of the fire of 1915. In the fall of 1915, according to an ad in the
			Peever Pilot, he and one of the Renvilles were ready for business again in the brick building that was to become
			our old community center.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>After Solon went to school in Michigan he came back to Peever and opened a Dodge car dealership.
			He operated this business until his death in 1918. Rueben LaBatte, who still lives in the Peever area, is the son
			of Solon and Hannah.</B></P>
