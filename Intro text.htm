<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Lucida Handwriting">Hello....</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Lucida Handwriting">I am Char Jarman and I would like to welcome you
to our Peever Community History website.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Lucida Handwriting">Since the year 2001 was our town's centennial we
have become very interested in the stories of our pioneers . Who were they?..Where did they came from..and what
did they do here? Did they stay? Did they move on? Where are they buried?</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Lucida Handwriting">For 29 months before the actual celebration this
summer a small group of us put together a publication that we named &quot;The Peever Pilot 2001&quot;. In it we
had new and old news and we always had a pioneer story that our readers were kind enough to provide us.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Lucida Handwriting">It seemed a good idea now to put these stories and
other history of our community on the internet where they might be read by others than our own local citizens.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Lucida Handwriting">Our centennial celebration was a great success .
It was held from the 29th of June through July 1. God blesssed us with the lovliest weather of the entire summer
and that helped to make it all the more special.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4" FACE="Lucida Handwriting">And so with these pages our intent is to honor those
hardy souls who moved this far west to make their homes in this beautiful valley and in the Coteau Des Prairie
hills. The homesteaders, the merchants, the professional men and women, and last but not least our own Native Sisseton
Wahpeton People who were here before any of us..........we salute you!</FONT></B></P>
