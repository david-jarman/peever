<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Harrison Davis was the son of John and Kathryn Davis, Irish Immigrants who
settled in Grant County, Wisconsin. He left home to homestead in 1910 in Corson County, South Dakota on the Standing
Rock Indian reservation.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Delmer and Emma (Ladyhoff) DeWolfe moved to Roberts County South Dakota with
their family before the turn of the century. When their oldest child, Lyle reached the age of 21 he went to western
South Dakota to homestead. He was later joined by his sister Alta who also filed and homesteaded there. Alta met
and married another homesteader, Harrison Davis. They had one child, Mildred. In 1930 they returned to Alta's home
area in Agency township, South Dakota where they resided for the rest of their lives.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">They originally purchased land in the hills of Roberts County and started a
sheep ranch. They raised sheep for many years and then changed to cattle and moved from the hills to a building
site in the foothills of Agency township near what was known as the Big Spring. They raised Hereford cattle and
Harrison continued his profession as an auctioneer.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">During the 1940's Harrison organized caravans of harvesters and took them to
Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Nebraska for the harvesting season. One of the pictures is of him beside his Massey
Harris combine holding his first grandchild Sandra Ramynke.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Harrison was a good friend of his neighbor Frank Whipple who promoted rodeos
in the summer and Harrison acted as his Rodeo announcer for many years.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Harrison had many friends among the Indians as they were close neighbors. One
of his best friends was Charlie Owen, the father of Pierce Owen and grandfather of Owen Dean German. Many of his
workers on the ranch came from these Indian families.</FONT></B></P>
