			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>After the Centennial the videos of various events were edited and copied. There are two separate
			videos. One contains the parade and other portions of the outside events. The other is a full length video of the
			play &quot;Profoundly Peever&quot; and the fashion show that preceded it on Sunday afternoon.</B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Profoundly Peever was an hour long musical comedy based on the history of Peever. It was co-
			written and directed by Valerie Hill, Char Jarman and Lindsey Dumire. The cast of over thirty actors and singers
			was made up of mostly Peever and Sisseton folks.</B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>The fashion show was a fascinating hour long production directed by Janinne Gerber, Lois Herniman
			and Darlene Iverson with piano music by Kim Lawrence. The clothes were donated and worn by friends and family with
			bits of history included by the narrators.</B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>The cost of the videos is $18.00 each and that includes the postage. If you are in Peever
			you can stop at Chars and buy one for $15.00. When writing to us please specify which video you would like.</B></P>
