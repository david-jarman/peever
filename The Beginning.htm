THE LITTLE TOWN CALLED PEEVER</font></b></p>
	<p style="background-color: white;" align="center"><font size="4">There's</font><b> </b><font size="4">a little town called Peever..we built along
	the track. We came here from the east and......we're never going back. It's got hotels, livery barns and banks.....shoe
	shops and grocery stores....And when more people move here they're sure to build some more.</font></p>

	<p style="background-color: white;" align="center"><font size="4">Harry Spackman and Tom Peever were the men who bought the land.......a plot of
	forty acres was the beginning of their plan. They began to sell the lots and soon the people flocked on down........to
	build new homes and businesses and help to build the town.</font></p>

			<p align="center"><b><font size="4">But before there was a little town called Peever there was a little town called
			Keller that was built in the 1890's about two miles up the tracks to the north. It was intended to be a depot for
			unloading the supplies that came to the Indian Agency which was five miles west of there. It was named Keller for
			Anton Keller who was one of the agents. It had, besides the depot, a post office, at least one store, a grain elevator
			and some houses. We aren't sure how many people actually lived there.</font></b></p>
			<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Samson Renville and his wife Rose were in charge of the post office and the
			store. You will read about Samson and Rose farther along in our Pioneer Pages, as they came to figure greatly in
			the life of Peever also.</font></b></p>
			<p align="center"><b><font size="4">But within a few years the decision was made to discontinue the town and that's
			when Tom Peever got his idea. There was a forty acre plot to the south of Keller that a homesteader was willing
			to sell and once this man got his patent ....the plan went into action without delay. There were three people actually
			involved with the investment. We hear alot about Peever and Spackman, but there is a shadowy figure in the background
			.... N.H. Miller..... whose name appears on many of the lots before they were resold. Who is N.H. Miller? I haven't
			a clue, but perhaps someone reading this might know.</font></b></p>
			<p align="center"><b><font size="4">Following are the actual records at the Roberts County Courthouse in Sisseton
			concerning the sale of the land to the investors: (Note that the day George Brunell received his patent he sold
			it immediately to Spackman, Peever and Miller.)</font></b></p>
			<p>
			</p><p align="center"><b><font size="5">12/6/1900&#8230;Patent from USA to George Brunell..Nw1/4 of NW ¼ of Sec. 8..124&#8230;range..50<br>
			12/6/1900&#8230;George Brunell to HL Spackman, TH Peever, NH Miller&#8230;NW ¼ of NW1/4 of 8-124-50<br>
			12/14/1900&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Platted the town of Peever&#8230;and signed by the above three men&#8230;.Spackman, Peever and Miller.</font></b></p>
			<p>
			</p><p align="center"><b><font size="4">Some of the buildings from Keller were moved to Peever. We know for certain
			that the grain elevator was moved and also the Renville's store building.</font></b></p>
			<p align="center"><b><font size="4">In the year of 1901 the town of Peever was incorporated and a list of names
			signing the legal papers are as follows: Walter Dinger, George W. Hensel, William Dinger, William C. Ferver, Pius
			Laing, Bert Bloomhall, W.E. Bickford, Samson Renville and Robert Butler. This document states..."List of the
			names of those voting at the special election held on July, 30, 1901 for the purpose of voting on the proposition
			of incorporating the town of Peever, Roberts County, South Dakota, at Bert Bloomhall's Hotel Building, in said
			proposed Town of Peever."</font></b></p>

			<p align="center"><b><font size="4">The rest, as we like to say, "Is history." The town of Peever is
			still here. I am going to copy a quotation from the last paragraph of the book "Maggie..Woman of Roberts County"written
			in 1998.</font></b></p>

			<p align="center"><b><font size="4">"The little town by the edge of the slough still stands, and nearing its
			hundredth year is remembering the early days. Ravaged by fires, flood, depression and drought, it goes on. Smaller
			by far, but not beaten yet. Unlike Travare and the many other ghost towns that dot the old maps of Roberts County,
			Peever, with the determination of its citizens, will move into the new century with hope."</font></b></p>
