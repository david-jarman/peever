			used to borrow a guitar from Lynn Behrns; keep it for awhile, practice &amp; then take it back. Eldon was the last
			of the boys to learn because the older brothers got to pick first. Said Eldon, &quot;If it wasn't for Lynn having
			a guitar &amp; willing to loan it to us, I may not have got started. We later got some cheaper guitars &amp; played
			&amp; got by.&quot; The first group he played with was Lowell Lundstrom's dance band. He later went to the west
			coast where he played with different groups in night clubs. Off &amp; on he played with Jim Keeble &amp; &quot;that's
			where I learned to cord &amp; got a lot of experience.&quot; Eldon went through a period when he didn't play at
			all for about 10-15 years. He got back to playing with a church group in Minneapolis. Upon returning to the Peever
			area he got aquainted with Leon Eneboe &amp; through him met Donny Backman. &quot;We used to get together at Big
			Coulee Store &amp; sit on a hay rack &amp; pick in the evening.&quot; At this point he got back into playing &amp;
			has been playing ever since. He played with Frank Keeble's Prairie Winds Band at sobriety dances &amp; also Dave
			Finstead &amp; God's Country. He has enjoyed his music partners and friends ever since.</FONT></TD>

			babysitting. Juanitta taught herself to pick guitar &amp; Franklin taught her how to cord later. She remembers
			picking at home in her bedroom &amp; her Mom encouraged her but said that her ears sometimes hurt with her plunking

			Effington area. His Dad dropped him off for piano lessons on his way to the feed store. Stopping back to pick him
			up on his way home, the piano teacher told his Dad to &quot;save your money&quot; muses Roger. Well, Roger then
			picked it up at home with a kind of a &quot;family band&quot; with his mom, brothers &amp; sisters. At Sisseton
			School he was involved in chorus, rather than band, because he wanted to play a trumpet instead of a squeaky clairnet
			&amp; the band already had enough trumpets. He then started steel guitar at about age 14. &quot;Eddy Arnold used
			to come on at 6:30 AM with Steel Guitarist Roy Wiggins &amp; I thought it was the most beatuiful sound I ever heard
			&amp; I started steel guitar.&quot; Roger's inspiritation to get serious about music came from 4th grade teacher
			Helen Westby who also taught music. His brother had taken up accordian &amp; when his brother was not around Roger
			would pick up his accordian &amp; mess around with it &amp; that's how he learned to play the accordian. He also
			learned a few songs on the banjo. Roger played with the Harold Johnson band for about 20 years. He also played
			with the Tony Marpinek Band. His 1st instrument was a flat top guitar with a picture of Buck Jones &amp; his horse
			on it. After that he bought a pedal steel guitar &amp; hung the Buck Jones guitar in the garage where it got rusty.
			About 6 months later a lady called called and said &quot;I got a guitar at a pawn shop, could you tune it for me?&quot;
			&quot;It was my old Buck Jones guitar&quot; muses Roger.</FONT></TD>

			family guitar ordered from the Spiegel Catalogue. His sister, Mable who was about 14 got to play first &amp; then
			when the guitar wasn't busy Jim got to play, he was around 7 or 8. Jim spent a lot of time around home learning
			to pick. The 1st time he played in public was in school at about the 3rd or 4th grade. He played at the school
			Halloween parties. The 1st band he played with was the Country Scandinivans. He also used to play at Lloyd Fredrickson's
			Store &amp; at the little school house with Donny &amp; Eldon &amp; others. Jim also played at the Bradley Jamboree
			with Dave Finstead. The scariest gig Jim recalls playing at was the State Pen, Sioux Falls. Says Jim, &quot;When
			those doors close..they close with authority! But we had a lot of fun playing there..we wondered if we would get
			out!&quot; Jim enjoys playing around the area with his friends. He dosen't go to far without his guitar..He even

		<TD WIDTH="50%"><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">Back in the &quot;hills&quot; where I was born &amp; lived the first 12 years
			of my life, there wasn't much to do for entertainment except for music. Having no phone or electricity a lot of
			the evenings were spent with my Dad, Alf Landmark, &amp; my sister Lylas playing &quot;Old Time&quot; &amp; Country
			Music. Dad played his fiddle &amp; Lylas the guitar. I was 7 years old when I joined the group having gotten a
			mandolin. C,D &amp; G were the 3 simple cords I learned to play &amp; from then on each time we would play I would
			learn something new.<BR>
			<BR>
			We all played by ear, not having the foggiest idea what all those little black squiggly things were on the music.
			At the age of 14 I got my first guitar. My sister Lylas taught me the cords Dad usually played in &amp; I learned
			from there by asking other musicians to show me-&quot;Where do I put my fingers for that cord?&quot; So from that
			time I have played with several Country Bands for many years. <BR>
			<BR>
			My band days are all over now, but we still get a group together to do benefits &amp; just plain old Ho-Downs.
			My daughter Janeen had a band along with her husband Ron Kohl for 25 years. Now my 3 daughters, Janeen, Julie &amp;
			Wendy sing &amp; play for many different occassions. They are known as &quot;The Landmark Sisters.&quot;<BR>
			<BR>
			So as you walk into one of Peever's Country Jamboree's, you know that night, you will be entertained...Edean L.</FONT></TD>

			guitar at around age 8..and her 1st paying gig was at the Waverly Legion at age 12. Janeen Kohl remembers getting
			her 1st guitar from SANTA at age 8. Her greatest music influence has been her Dad, Edean. Janeen has been a community
			&amp; area musician since then. Peeverites recall Janeen getting up &amp; singing at Peever Talent Shows &amp;
			belting out a heck of a tune that the entire audience loved! Things haven't changed..Peeverites loved her music
			then &amp; they love it now!<BR>

			Wendy's 1st public gig was at the &quot;76&quot; Snoose Alley Bash when she was 5 years old; she got up &amp; sang
			&quot;Teddy Bear&quot; accompanied by her Dad Edean &amp; sister Janeen. She has sung at most of the Bashes since
			that time with various family members including Julie, Susie &amp; Jill. At schools she did solo spots in concerts
			&amp; sang in Chorus &amp; contests. Not to our surprise, Wendy was awarded Superior all 4 yrs. in Chorus. While
			in H.S. she sang off &amp; on with sister Janeen's dance band. When Janeen got a Karaoke Machine...well Wendy got
			involved with that too...&amp; enjoyed singing Karaoke around the area. She has sung for many various gatherings
			around the area.<BR>
			<BR>
			About 3 years ago Janeen, Wendy &amp; Julie decided to get together every now and then &amp; have a bit of fun
			as the &quot;Norske Chicks,&quot;...they topped the &quot;Local&quot; song chart with &quot;Good-bye Ole!&quot;
			(I think it's time to hear this one again) Before this they had gotten together &amp; sang as the &quot;Landmark
			Sisters &quot; &amp; today continue to entertain audiences as such...Although every now &amp; then the &quot;Chicks&quot;
			pop in! When asked about instruments...Wendy replies... &quot;Janeen plays guitar, Julie plays harmonica &amp;
			I play the radio...KS 93 please! <BR>
			<BR>
			THANK YOU...Wendy, Julie &amp; Janeen for sharing your talent &amp; humor with us!! We look forward to more GOOD
