			<p align="center"><b>"There is need of a church edifice in Peever and we believe that if the matter is taken
			hold of by some good hustler that enough money could be pledged to erect a church. We understand that the town
			site proprietors have signified their willingness to donate a lot. When the band was organized our public spirited
			citizens were not long in pledging a hundred dollars, and if given the opportunity to show their liberality in
			the erection of a church we believe they will respond with many shekels of gold and silver."</b>

			<p align="center"><b>On May 4th of 1997 the ground breaking ceremony was held for the new church. The building
			throughout that year was done by much volunteer work. In September of 1998 the congregation moved into their new
			building. It is a lovely facility and a testimony to what a few determined people can accomplish with the help
			of God.</b></p>
