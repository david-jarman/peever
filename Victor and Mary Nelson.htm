<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Victor was born in 1878 on a farm near Kerkhovan, Minnesota. He was next to
the youngest in a family of ten children. As a young man of fifteen, he learned the blacksmith trade from his older
brother.</FONT> <FONT SIZE="4">Mary Abrahamson was born in 1879 on a farm twenty miles west of Princeton, known
as Glendorado, Minnesota.</FONT></B></P>

	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Victor moved to Great Falls, Montana when he was about twenty years of age.
	He had a sister living there who was married to a foreman of the Copper Smelters. Victor got a job in the copper
	smelters through his brother in law. About that same time, Mary decided to go to Great Falls with her cousin. They
	both got a job in the laundry. Somehow Victor and Mary met through mutual friends and were married October 1, 1901.
	They lost their first child, Lawrence, who died of pneumonia at the age of one.</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">When the Copper Smelters went on strike, Victor was out of a job. However,
Victor's brother Alfred, who lived in Peever and had a mercantile store, told Victor that a blacksmith job was
open in Claire City, SD. While working there he heard that he could buy a blacksmith shop at Frank Post Office
near Eden. This was about forty miles northwest of Peever. All that was there was a Catholic Church, a parsonage,
a post office, blacksmith shop and a little shack of a house. While living there they had three children, Orle,
Wallace, and Ella. There was no high school in that area and Victor wanted his children to have a high school education.
It so happened that his brother, Alfred, told Victor that there was a blacksmith shop for sale in Peever, so in
1910 they moved to Peever. They lost another baby boy Walter, from pneumonia in 1913. Viola was born that same
year and Floyd in 1916.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Around 1916, Victor and his nephew Ted Nelson, an auto mechanic, formed a partnership
and built a combination garage and blacksmith shop. During WW1 grain prices shot up and Victor and Ted let out
a great deal of credit to farmers. After the war the bottom of the grain market fell so the farmers could not pay
their bills and Victor and Ted were in debt. In 1923 both banks went broke and Ted Nelson went to California leaving
Victor and Mary to struggle alone. Mary took in boarders and roomers to help supplement their income.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">In 1934 at the height of the depression, the garage and blacksmith shop burned
to the ground. In trying to save money Victor had dropped his fire insurance. He lost his car and $100.00 in new
tires plus his business. However the two gas pumps were still okay.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">There was an old lumber yard building across the street that belonged to the
County. Victor was completely broke, but somehow he talked the County Commissioners into selling him the building.
He got the local house movers to move it where the garage used to be. One of the town carpenters, Pete Nickstad,
remodeled it into small living quarters, and an office for the business. At the age of fifty six, Victor was starting
all over.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Victor sold his business to Alvin Tuff in 1952 after being in business in Peever
for forty two years. After Victor retired he worked for Harold Hortness part time.</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Victor was very loyal to the town of Peever. If anyone spoke negatively about
the town they were soon set straight.</FONT></B></P>

Pilot 2001.)</FONT></B></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Joel Hortness tells this little story about his Grandpa Victor as remembered
by his mother, Viola. After the garage had burned, someone asked Victor if he was moving to Sisseton now. His reply
was &quot;If we had wanted to live in Sisseton, I would have taken Mary by the hand and walked up the tracks.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
