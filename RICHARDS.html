<small><span style="font-weight: bold;"><big>BEN RICHARDS WAS BORN IN WALES
ON MAY 8, 1866. HE CAME TO THE USA AT THE AGE OF 28 AND BECAME A
CITIZEN IN 1896. HE WAS A FARM LABORER IN WISCONSIN FOR A FEW YEARS.
THIS IS WHERE HE MET HIS WIFE MARY JONES. SHE WAS BORN IN WISCONSIN IN
1877. THEY WERE MARRIED FEBRUARY 27, 1901. THEY FARMED IN WISCONSIN FOR
A FEW YEARS BEFORE COMING TO SOUTH DAKOTA WHERE THEY BOUGHT THE FARM
ABOUT 7 MILES WEST OF PEEVER IN AGENCY TOWNSHIP. THE LAND HAD BEEN
HOMESTEADED AND PROVED UP BY OSLE TOSTENSON. THE PLACE HAD A WHITE
HOUSE&nbsp; AND IT WAS CALLED "THE BIG WHITE HOUSE ON TOP OF THE HILL."
FOR THOSE WHO KNOW THE THE FARM THE BIG WHITE HOUSE WAS ONLY THE
KITCHEN PART WITH AN UPSTAIRS THAT WAS JUST THE RAFTERS OF THE FRAME OF
THE HOUSE. <br>
<br>

IT MUST HAVE BEEN A REALLY FULL HOUSE AS WHEN THEY MOVED IN THERE WERE
BEN AND MARY WITH THEIR FIVE BOYS, BABY MARGARET AND A HIRED
GIRL!&nbsp; IN 1910 THEY BUILT A BARN AND ALSO STARTED BUILDING ONTO
THE HOUSE BUT DIDN'T FINISH IT UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR. MARTHA AND
GWEN WERE BORN AFTER THEY MOVED THERE.<br>

MARY HAD TWO SISTERS LIBBY AND JANE AND ALSO A BROTHER DICK JONES. HE
CAME TO AGENCY TOWNSHIP AND PURCHASED 60 ACRES NEARBY. BUT DICK DID NOT
LIKE THE WINTERS HERE, ESPECIALLY IN THE HILLS WHERE THE SNOW COULD
REALLY BLOW SO HE WENT BACK TO WISCONSIN LEAVING HIS ACRES TO BEN.<br>
