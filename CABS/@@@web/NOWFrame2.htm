FROM THE WILMOT ENTERPRISE APRIL 9, 1931</SPAN></B></P>

<P><B><SPAN STYLE="Font-Size : 12pt"><BR>
MISSES MYRTLE THEILE, CLARICE LAKE, BEATRICE SYKORA, OLIVIA NIXSTAD, VERA JURGENS AND MILDRED KELLEY HAD A VERY
NARROW ESCAPE FROM SERIOUS INJURY WHEN THE CAR IN WHICH THEY WERE COMING HOME FOR THE EASTER VACATION TURNED TURTLE
INTO A DITCH NEAR PIERPONT, WHEN PASSING ANOTHER CAR. AFTER GETTING A TRACTOR TO RIGHT THE CAR THEY PROCEEDED ON
THEIR WAY UNTIL TWO MILES EAST OF ROSLYN WHEN THE SAME THING OCCURRED AND THEY WERE AGAIN UPSET INTO THE DITCH
HALF FILLED WITH MUD AND WATER. THIS TIME NO CARS CHANCED BY TO HELP, GAS AND OIL RAN OUT OF THE CAR AND THE WHOLE
PARTY WAS OBLIGED TO WALK TWO MILES BACK TO ROSLYN IN THE SLUSH AND DARK. THEY ARRIVED AT PEEVER AT 12:30, SHAKEN,
BRUISED AND FRIGHTENED BUT GRATEFUL THAT THERE WAS NO FATAL TRAGEDIES.</SPAN></B></P>
