			worry about your money. We are prepared to loan you just as much money as ever. This will not effect your business
			with the bank in the least.</FONT></B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">On account of having no safe we do not expect to keep much cash. Our cash will
			be kept in other banks until our new safe arrives, during which time we will only keep enough cash for change in
			Peever.</FONT></B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">For the next few weeks we ask you to transact your business with the bank between

			Carl J. Rice, Cashier</FONT></B></P>
