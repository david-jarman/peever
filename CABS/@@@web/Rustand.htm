			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="#003399">With their two oldest children (Ludvig and Marie) already in America,
			Karl (Larsen) and Karen Andrine Kofstad) Rustand made the necessary preparations for leaving Norway to join them.
			They old their 3-story home, closed up his business (Karl demonstrated and sold Singer Sewing Machines), packed
			only clothes, tools, and household necessities in three big trunks, said their farewells, and with their remaining
			children:Konrad (11), John(9), Ragna (7), Wilhelm &quot;Bill&quot; (4), and Valberg (2), left the Kongsberg countryside
			of Kristiania (now Oslo) to board the Montibelo on September 18, 1903 for the trip over the North Sea. The storm
			tossed seas wreaked havoc on its passengers but the Montibelo arrived safely at Hull, England three days later.</FONT></B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="#003399">The Rustands continued on the Great Central Railway across England to
			Liverpool, where they departed on September 25 aboard the White Star Liner Cedrich. This was a comparative smooth
			journey and they arrived at the port of New York (before Ellis Island) on October 3, 1903.</FONT></B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="#003399">After their checkups and the shots that made their arms sore for many
			days, they left New York by rail to Minneapolis and on the Wilmot, SD, arriving there on October 7, 1903.</FONT></B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="#003399">Uncle Anton Foss picked them up at the Levy's store and they spent a
			few days at his farm before going on to the John Foss farm, 8 miles northeast of Wilmot, where their new home waited
			for them. &quot;</FONT><I><FONT COLOR="#003399">Ma cried when she saw it&quot;</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="#003399">,
			but they braved their first two South Dakota winters is this little sod house, which was simply a one room shack
			pressed against a small hill with one room above ground and the other three steps down and underground. </FONT><I><FONT
			COLOR="#003399">&quot;It had windows with 6 panes each, one window in the west, one in the south, and one in the
			east. The room that was builtin the ground was four feet longer one way that the other and it had a stovepipe that
			came up through the ground. A bit cook stove was in the center. Ma was heartsick that whole first year, but we
			had to make the most of whatever came our way. We couldn't go back. We didn't have any money.&quot;</FONT></I></B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="#003399">&quot;Actually, we had it a lot better than the others who came over
			before us. Dad's brother, Anton, John and Martin didn't have much more than their horses and a shotgun when they
			started out. You see, in Norway when you became 18 you were expected to join the army. They decided to come to
			America instead. Then Anton sent tickets to Marie and Ludvig, who wrote back about the opportunities here, and
			Ma was lonesome for them. That's what made Dad decide to come too.&quot;</FONT></I></B></P>

			<FONT COLOR="red">LIFE IN ROBERTS COUNTY</FONT></B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="red">&quot;That first fall was nice enough, we were barefoot until Thanksgiving.
			Anton Foss came with two dogs, Dan and Pat, and they were two of the nicest pointers I ever saw. Anton and Ludvig
			took their shotguns down in the fields and the dogs would just point at the prairie chickens and that was our first
			Thanksgiving dinner. We always had potatoes, bread and coffee, nothing very fancy.&quot;</FONT></I></B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="red">By Christmas winter set in with a vengeance and they had to stay inside
			most of the time. </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="red">&quot;When it got really cold, Ma just sent us to bed. But after
			two winters, Karl built a frame house and Ole Brauther, a neighbor and kind of handyman, helped put the roof on.
			Konny helped, too, but he nearly fell off. He rolled down from the peak and caught himself on the edge and hung
			on good.</FONT></I></B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="red">Marie was working for a Miss Adams, who was unmarried, and needed her
			help with the sheep and chickens. I don't know how it happened but she chopped off her thumb while wielding an
			ax intended for a chicken. Got infection real bad.&quot;</FONT></I></B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="red">Years later, Bill would insist he couldn't remember much about Norway. Born
			February 10, 1899, </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="red">&quot;I was just a little fellow when I left there.&quot;</FONT></I><FONT
			COLOR="red"> But of the home they lived in and sold prior to leaving for America, Bill recalled that </FONT><I><FONT
			COLOR="red">&quot;there were two other families living in it. We lived on the first floor, another family (the
			Ruhr's) lived on the second floor and they got pretty good rent from them. A pair of chimney sweeps lived on the
			third floor and they didn't have to pay much in rent.&quot; The people who bought the house from them could not
			come up with the 3000 crowns needed so the Rustands left for America with ony a promise that the money would be
			sent to them. &quot;It never came so the folks had to hire lawyers to collect it. Dad did a lot of writing back
			and forth, but in the end the lawyers got all the money and we didn't see any of it.&quot;</FONT></I></B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="blue">On the trip from Norway, Bill recalled sitting on his dad's shoulders and
			watching the burial at sea of a woman 'bout 40 or so. And he remembers going over the North Sea in the Montebelo
			and being </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="blue">&quot;so gall darned sick we didn't care if we lived or died.&quot; He had
			a bottom bunk and</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="blue"> in the top bunk was someone even sicker who threw up over the side
			of his bunk causing Bill to be constanty wiping up vomit--his own and his fellow passenger's.</FONT></B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="blue">In the late 40's early 50's when Bill was buying and selling cream, eggs
			and poultry in his little corner store on Manin Street in Peever, he would often cross the street to Holland's
			Grocery and spend the time of day reminiscing. It was on one of these occaisions that Andrew Holland told Bill
			about his own trip to America and how awfully sick he was. He could only roll over, put his head out of his top
			bundk and let it fly. Bill needed not further convincing as to who his fellow passenger was that caused him such
			misery. </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="blue">&quot;Aw, putt, that was Andrew!&quot;</FONT></I></B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="red">&quot; I learned more outside of the schoolhouse than I ever did inside.
			I just had to cross over the section line to go to school and I started playing with the kids outside at recess
			and then I learned to speak English and understand it some. Anne Flannery got me to come inside and she was my
			first teacher. I also had a man teacher named Llittle (he was small too, but his right name was Little) and Lena
			Diddes and then I finished up with Lois Walker in 8th grade.&quot;</FONT></I></B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="red">&quot;I went to school with Charlie Swayze, Billuy Swayze, Fye and Froence,
			and the Dows, Irene, Rudy, Oscar, Eddie and Virginia. And there was Andrew McDonald. The second year, more came.
			There was Billy Camerson, Gordon Cameron, Alvin Camerson, Clarence Madsen and Rose Madsen. Bernard and Edna Friner,
			and the Stetson kids, Gilbert, Signe and Jenny and that was it until the Walkers moved in. going to school in them
			days was a lot different than these days. The teachers didn't know that much more that we did...&quot;</FONT></I></B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><I><FONT COLOR="red">&quot;I was confirmed by pastor O.J. Holden in the old wooden Lutheren
			church thata was moved from Wilmot to Rosholt or Clear Lake in the 40's. On my confirmation day when I was 14 or
			maybe 15, my dad said to me, 'now you know right f</FONT></I><FONT COLOR="red">rom </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="red">wrong
			and if you get it trouble , you are own your own.'&quot;</FONT></I></B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT COLOR="blue">About WW1. </FONT><I><FONT COLOR="blue">&quot;They declared war in the
			spring of 1918 and finished up in 1918. But they took enlistments before that and Ludvig</FONT><FONT COLOR="red">
			</FONT><FONT COLOR="blue">joined the army and was stationed in Euope when they declared on Germany. Shortly after
			that, Konrad got drafted and was in camp only a fdw days when they found out he had flase teeth and they turned
			him loose. They drafted John, but sent him back saying that they wouldn't take him unless it got real necessary.
			I wanted to enlist but Dad wouldn't let me because he thought he needed me on the farm. Then I got drafted anyway,
			but I was told to wait for further word--and I'm still waiting. Clarence Ward was the first one drafted and they
			took 23 from Roberts County.&quot;</FONT></I></B>
