			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>In the years of 1895-96 several families of Norwegian and Swedish descent arrived in Roberts
			County and settled in what is now Drywood Lake and One Road townships. They were without any organizations whatsoever.
			No schools or churches. Rev. L.E. Kjelaas was at the time serving a small congregation and in the winter of 1897
			just a few days before Christmas he held the first service in the new settlement.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>On January 2, 1898 at the home of Nels Lysing it was decided to organize a congregation. On
			January 24 another meeting was held at the John Lindberg home at which time a constitution voted to name the newly
			organized congregation, &quot;Bethel.&quot;</B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Rev. Kjelaas was called to serve as pastor of the congregation. The church was built in 1906.</B>
