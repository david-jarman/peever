			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS FROM THE BOOK..HISTORY OF SISSETON, SOUTH DAKOTA</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><BR>
			Lawrence Township had only one rural school because it was a small township and Peever Independent School extended
			on to include several sections.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Lawrence School No. 1 was located in the southwest quarter of the southeast quarter of section
			20, three miles south and 3/4 miles west of Peever. The County Superintendent sent about five of us five year olds
			home when we tried to start school as the teacher had 41 pupils in eight grades without us.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>When the original schoolhouse burned down in the fall of 31 or 32, school was conducted at
			the home of Melvin Lawrence, where Eldon Lawrence, a great grandson of Lorenzo Lawrence, now lives. Melvin and
			his family moved upstairs and classes were held in two rooms on the ground floor. During the next summer Pete Nickstad
			(and Andrew Tuff) of Peever constructed a new school on the original site.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Some of the teachers I can remember were: Margaret McAdaragh, (who was there when the superintendent
			sent us home), Bride Kelly, ( who was the teacher when the schoolhouse burned), Helen Radke, Cora Christiansen,
			Francis Stapleton, Robert Stapleton, his wife Edna,(now Mrs. Manguel Nelson finished out the term),Mildred (Kelly)
			Gardner, Audrey (Behrns) Elrite,Jeanne (Chilson) Leiseth,Gayle (Gunderson) Hanson, Shirley (Hove) Bassett, and
			Gladys (Theile) Christiansen.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>These are some of the families who attended the school: Silas Greely, James Horne, Aaron Theile,
			Joe Flute, John Wren, Jorgen Jorgenson, Andrew Drovdahl,Louie German, Bill Egan, Henry German, Hugo Schloe, Melvin
			Odden, Hans Bonrud, Olaf Aspelund, George Nerison, Funston, Dwight Gerber, Earl Owen, Abel Greely, Phyllis Lewis,
			Ed Greely, Melvin Lawrence, Harris Thompson, Harry Hein, George Elrite, Theodore Tostenson, Herman Pomrenke, Fred
			Lawrence, and Melvin Behrns.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>The school was closed in 1964. The building was then sold to Ephriam Redearth, who moved it
			three miles west and a half mile south of Peever and converted it to a family dwelling.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Long live the memory of the rural schools that accomplished their tasks so well.</B></P>
