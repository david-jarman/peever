			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>In the year 1902 a group of Norwegian and Danish immigrant settlers saw the need to gather
			and be nourished by God's Word and Sacraments in the growing community of Peever. Pastor C.M. Peterson began to
			organize a Lutheran congregation within the area. Pastor Peter Kilnes was called to serve what was then known as
			the Sisseton Agency Norwegian Lutheran Church and Trinity Lutheran Church in Sisseton, South Dakota. He was installed
			in 1903.</B>

		<TD WIDTH="51%">
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Services were conducted in the schoolhouse until shortly before Christmas in 1911 when the
			new church was completed. The lot for the new church at the north end of Peever was donated by Carl J. Rice. Pastor
			Kilnes and a neighbor boy did most of the excavating for the basement. The boy held the scraper and Pastor Kilnes
			drove the ponies. Mr. Beito of New Effington, South Dakota was contracted to build the church. Pastor Kilnes served
			the congregation until 1914.</B>
