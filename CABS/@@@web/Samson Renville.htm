	Samson and Rose Renville lived in Peever in the early days when the town was started. They were a busy couple keeping
	a business and raising a large family. I am going to copy an article from the Wilmot enterprise to begin our portrait
	of the Renvilles. This was written at the time of their 55th anniversary celebration. The date of the newspaper
	was September 18, 1947.</B></P>
	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>&quot;In the picture above is the likeness of Mr. and Mrs. Samson Renville, honored and respected
	residents of Agency Township, and their fine family taken some time ago. On September 10, the couple observed their
	55th wedding anniversary and a large number of neighbors and other friends were well represented at a gathering
	at their home in Agency township to extend greetings and good wishes. All report having enjoyed the afternoon visiting
	and the lunch served. Mr. and Mrs. Renville were the recipients of numerous gifts and a purse of money. Frank Dudeck
	of Peever made the presentation with suitable remarks.</B></P>
	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Mr. and Mrs. Samson Renville were married at Wilmot on September 10, 1892 by the late Judge
	JJ Batterson. At the time both were employed as clerks at the same store at Sisseton Agency. They continued to
	lived at the Agency and were employed there until 1898, when they purchased a store and assumed the duties of postmaster
	at Keller, a new town which was started just north of where Peever now stands. Keller went out of existence when
	Peever was founded. In 1901 Mr. and Mrs. Renville moved their store to Peever, where they were actively engaged
	in business until about 20 years ago when they retired to their old homestead in Agency Township.</B></P>
	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Ten children were born to Mr. and Mrs. Renville. One died in infancy, and a married daughter,
	Daisy, passed away several years ago. Only one of the children, Gilbert, and family of Buchton, Kans. was able
	to be home for the happy event. The rest had visited their parents earlier so as to bring happiness and contentment
	to them throughout the summer months.</B></P>
	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>The other children are: Mrs. A.F. (fleeta) Rabe of St. Petersburg, Fla., Mrs. M.M. (Florence)
	Young of Casper, Wyo., Mrs. R.A. (Germaine) Williams of Denver, Colo., Leroy of Denver, Mrs. R.M. (Juanita) Chase
	of San Diego, Calif., Mrs. R.A. (Uarda) Kier of Strahon, Iowa, and Sylvan of Peever.</B></P>
	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Mr. and Mrs. Renville are friendly people and number their friends by all who know them. They
	have reared and educated a wonderful family of boys and girls, of whom they are justly proud, their pride being
	shared by the community. They have lived a long and useful life and are enjoying a well-earned rest on the old
	farm south of Old Agency.</B></P>
	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>The Enterprise joins their wide circle of friends in wishing them many more happy anniversaries.&quot;</B></P>

	then to Peever where they figured largely in early day history of our town.</B></P>
	<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Their grandson, Delano Renville, a son of Sylvan and Flora, shared with us a few memories
	of his grandparents. how he enjoyed going out to the farm to stay with them. The children would have to help with
	chores around the place and he especially remembers cutting wood with a cross cut saw.</B></P>

	and Samson lived to the age of 90 when he passed away in 1961.</B></P>
