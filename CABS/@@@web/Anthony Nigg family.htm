			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">This story begins with Joseph Nigg and his wife Nothburga Hassler Nigg who
			came to America from Liechtenstein in 1881.They were brave and hardy pioneers who were not afraid of work and endured
			many hardships during their first years in Roberts County.Two daughters from Joseph's first marriage came with
			them to the new country. Their names were Christine and Katherine.</FONT></B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Before the family settled in Roberts County they spent several years in Iowa
			after arriving. Then about 1888 they moved the family to Ramona, SD and took up a farm. It was here that they got
			started in livestock. Joseph rented the farm and cared for a number of cattle for the owner. He was to get half
			the increase and all the milk produced for his work and feed. In that way he began to build a herd of his own.
			They stayed in this area until the drought of 1893. There were no crops and and no hay to feed the cattle and horses.
			Joseph heard of some good grassland on an Indian reservation to the north. So after checking it out he found that
			it was true and that there was land to rent . Then with the help of friends he managed to make a dugout on the
			edge of the hill and shelters for the animals. Before winter set in he returned for the family and their belongings
			were loaded in two wagons. Of course the cattle had to be driven The family spent the winter living in the dugout
			in primitive conditions</FONT></B></P>
