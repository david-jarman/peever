			<B>This postcard was sent to us at Peever by a member of the Opitz family who wrote to us from Minnesota It is
			a rare treasure as it is dated November 1910. It is written to a Math Opitz at Frank, South Dakota by (Aunt) Christine,
			who we understand was the late Matt Opitz' wife.</B>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>In 1902 Mathias (Matt) Opitz, who came to Peever from Frank Postoffice, built a wooden store
			building on the corner of block 7 on the east side of Main Street. He stocked all items of clothing, yard good
			and whatever made up the term &quot;dry goods.&quot; He was an ambitious and friendly man who made many improvements
			in the few years that he was able. On the front of the building in large letters was a name in Dakota language
			that was puzzling at first. But when translated it meant &quot;Bald Man's Store&quot;. So it was obvious that Matt
			had a sense of humor as well.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><BR>
			Mathias died in 1909 when in his forties. After his death some of the family continued the business, but we don't
			know for how long.</B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>In 2000 when doing research for the Peever Pilot the Jarmans found the graves of Mathias Opitz
			and his family in the cemetery near the old town that was once Frank Postoffice.</B>

			Below is a photo taken April 12, 2002. Jarman Bros. Construction of Cokato, MN. was doing some much needed repair
			on the false front of the 100 year old Opitz Store Building. They also shingled the south half of the roof. Shown
			in the picture are Bill Jarman of Dassel,MN. and Jeff Jarman of Aberdeen,SD. Also involved with the repair work
			for Ma and Pa Jarman's Cafe were Phillip and Cody of Minnesota and Brad of Canton, SD.</B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>In 1939, after a period of apparent disuse, the Opitz Store was once again a thriving business
			on the main street of Peever.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Nels and Orphia Hanson opened a cafe and 3.2 beer bar in the building and it has been that
			ever since. The next owners were Lillian and Erling Erickson and in 1977 it was sold to Allen and Char Jarman who
			are the present owners. A number of years ago the bar was discontinued and a small grocery store put in. And that
			is what it is today. In May of 2002 the Jarmans will have been in business 25 years and the building will be 100
			years old.</B></P>
