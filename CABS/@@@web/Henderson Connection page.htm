			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">It was unknown to us until we began to research the life and death of Tom Peever
			at the beginning of our centennial preparations. When we finally found Tom's obituary, it stated that his body
			was &quot;taken by train to Henderson Minnesota, for burial.&quot;</FONT></B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">As written in Tom Peever's biography on the Pioneer Page his first marriage
			was to Agnes Rice. Agnes Rice was a granddaughter of J.R. Brown and his wife Susan Frenier Brown.</FONT></B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Susan Brown died at their son Sam Brown's house in Browns Valley and is buried
			in St. Mary's Episcopal cemetery at Old Agency near Peever. However, her husband is buried with the Rice family.That
			is where Agnes was buried and where Tom was laid beside her in an unmarked grave.</FONT></B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B><FONT SIZE="4">Thanks to these helpful people at the historical society and cemetery board
			at Henderson we were able to find the records: Arlene Busse and Carmen and Stanley Wigand.</FONT></B>
