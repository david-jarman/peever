			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Bert and Lola Bloomhall go way back in Peever. Bert was one of the signers of the incorporation
			of the town. In 1903 there is record of them buying lots 23 and 24 of block 9 from A.. Miller. They held this property
			until 1918 when the record states that they sold it to A. F. Erstgaard. Their son in law was Adolph Erstgaard so
			that is more than likely the same person. At that time they moved to Milbank where they lived with their son Lester
			and his wife Agnes. Bert worked with Lester on his dray line for 32 years.</B></P>
			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Agnes Bloomhall was still living in Milbank at the time we printed this Pioneer portrait in
			the Peever Pilot 2001..(the August 2000 issue.) She gave us the family information and the picture. Other information

			in business and for fun.</B></P>
