			By Edean Landmark <BR>
			<BR>
			Alf was bom in 1896 and Josie (Lobben) Landmark in 1900. They both grew up in the Peever area and spent their whole
			lifetime here except when Alf went to the army in WW I. He spent two years of his life in Germany and France while
			Mom spent her time being a store clerk at Wist, SD. <BR>
			When he returned from the war they were married and started their life together as farmers. Five children were
			bom to form this family: Garfield, Arletta, Doris, Lylas, and Edean. <BR>
			<BR>
			They made their home &quot;up in the hills&quot; for many years where Dad took care of cattle for the Kellys. Later
			they purchased their own place and built a house and had the typical farm with cows, sheep, horses, pigs and chickens.
			<BR>
			<BR>
			In 1947 my parents sold the place in the hills. They purchased lots from Harry Dunham here in Peever and built
			a home which we moved into when I was twelve years old. <BR>
			<BR>
			My Dad worked as a carpenter and was also Peever cop for two years. When the water works was dug in for the town,
			Dad was working for the town. A lot of the digging was done by hand to go around large rock in the trenches. <BR>
			<BR>
			Mom was always active in the Ladies Aid and church. She also used to like to attend all the school events. Mom
			used to enjoy baking and would cook up a lot of Norwegian dishes for the holidays. <BR>
			<BR>
			Mom passed away in 1960 at the age of 60 and is buried in the Bethel Cemetery in the hills. Dad lived alone in
			the house they built here in Peever until 1978 when he passed away at the age of 83. He is buried in Bethel Cemetery
			also. <BR>
			<BR>
			Dad had many friends here in the community. After he became a widower, you would find him at either Buffalo Lake
			or Lake Traverse fishing with one of his buddies. Anton Pletten and Alf spent many days by the water.</B>
