			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>This little church that was named for an Irish Saint, was a mission of St. Peter's at Sisseton.
			The Dudeck and Kelly families were instrumental in having it built in Peever. </B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>People still remember going to mass there on Sunday mornings with visiting priests from Wilmot
			or Sisseton. First Communions would be held at St. Peters.</B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>Some Peever ladies recall the weddings of both Dudeck girls in this church, however. &quot;They
			were beautiful weddings!&quot;</B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>St. Columbkil closed in the late forties and eventually the little building was moved out
			of town, but no one is sure where.</B></P>

			<P ALIGN="CENTER"><B>The picture at left shows a part of the church that was at the far south end of town. The
			street that the boys are standing on runs east and west. If you look closely you can see the Banker Rice house
			in the background on the south side of the street beyond the church.</B>
