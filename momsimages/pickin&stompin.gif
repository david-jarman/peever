			used to borrow a guitar from Lynn Behrns; keep it for awhile, practice &amp; then take it back. Eldon was the last
			of the boys to learn because the older brothers got to pick first. Said Eldon, &quot;If it wasn't for Lynn having
			a guitar &amp; willing to loan it to us, I may not have got started. We later got some cheaper guitars &amp; played
			&amp; got by.&quot; The first group he played with was Lowell Lundstrom's dance band. He later went to the west
			coast where he played with different groups in night clubs. Off &amp; on he played with Jim Keeble &amp; &quot;that's
			where I learned to cord &amp; got a lot of experience.&quot; Eldon went through a period when he didn't play at
			all for about 10-15 years. He got back to playing with a church group in Minneapolis. Upon returning to the Peever
			area he got aquainted with Leon Eneboe &amp; through him met Donny Backman. &quot;We used to get together at Big
			Coulee Store &amp; sit on a hay rack &amp; pick in the evening.&quot; At this point he got back into playing &amp;
			has been playing ever since. He played with Frank Keeble's Prairie Winds Band at sobriety dances &amp; also Dave
			Finstead &amp; God's Country. He has enjoyed his music partners and friends ever since.</FONT></TD>

			Juanitta came to our area from Campbellsville, Kentucky. She came out to visit her sister Shirley &amp; help with
			babysitting. Juanitta taught herself to pick guitar &amp; Franklin taught her how to cord later. She remembers
			picking at home in her bedroom &amp; her Mom encouraged her but said that her ears sometimes hurt with her plunking
			around. Juanitta says her Mom wondered if she would EVER learn to pick...But we all know SHE DID..!&nbsp;</FONT><FONT

			picked at his house, he had a band, and Frank used to hang around and listen. He eventually started playing with
			them as rhythm guitar. About 1983 or so Frank started playing for sobriety dances and they were looking for band
			members &amp; that is how he met Eldon, Donny &amp; LaVern. They formed a group called Prairie Winds.</FONT></TD>

			Opitz. Ron wrote the chords down on paper and that's how he learned. He first played at Old Cranks, Melvins Cafe,
			and on Wednesday nights he played at Lloyd's with Jim Anderson from Eden, Duke Kurrasch &amp; Harold Amos. For
			about 10 years he played with the Country Scandinavians. He also played with Doc Larsens Red Suspender Band. Donny
			has always played for benefits around our community and area. It is no surprise that Donny, along with Leon Eneboe,
			Elden Lawrence, Frank Keeble &amp; Alex Jordan also volunteer their talent and time at the Salvation Army. <BR>

		<TD WIDTH="64%"><FONT FACE="Arial Rounded MT Bold">&nbsp;Roger Pearson got started with music at about age 6 up around the New
			Effington area. His Dad dropped him off for piano lessons on his way to the feed store. Stopping back to pick him
			up on his way home, the piano teacher told his Dad to &quot;save your money&quot; muses Roger. Well, Roger then
			picked it up at home with a kind of a &quot;family band&quot; with his mom, brothers &amp; sisters. At Sisseton
			School he was involved in chorus, rather than band, because he wanted to play a trumpet instead of a squeaky clairnet
			&amp; the band already had enough trumpets. He then started steel guitar at about age 14. &quot;Eddy Arnold used
			to come on at 6:30 AM with Steel Guitarist Roy Wiggins &amp; I thought it was the most beatuiful sound I ever heard
			&amp; I started steel guitar.&quot; Roger's inspiritation to get serious about music came from 4th grade teacher
			Helen Westby who also taught music. His brother had taken up accordian &amp; when his brother was not around Roger
			would pick up his accordian &amp; mess around with it &amp; that's how he learned to play the accordian. He also
			learned a few songs on the banjo. Roger played with the Harold Johnson band for about 20 years. He also played
			with the Tony Marpinek Band. His 1st instrument was a flat top guitar with a picture of Buck Jones &amp; his horse
			on it. After that he bought a pedal steel guitar &amp; hung the Buck Jones guitar in the garage where it got rusty.
			About 6 months later a lady called called and said &quot;I got a guitar at a pawn shop, could you tune it for me?&quot;
			&quot;It was my old Buck Jones guitar&quot; muses Roger.</FONT></TD>
