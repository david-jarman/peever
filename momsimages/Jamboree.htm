		<TD WIDTH="64%" BGCOLOR="#BCBCBC"><FONT FACE="Andy">Eldon first started picking at about age 6 using a family guitar. They also used to borrow a
			guitar from Lynn Behrns; keep it for awhile, practice &amp; then take it back. Eldon was the last of the boys to
			learn because the older brothers got to pick first. Said Eldon, &quot;If it wasn't for Lynn having a guitar &amp;
			willing to loan it to us, I may not have got started. We later got some cheaper guitars &amp; played &amp; got
			by.&quot; The first group he played with was Lowell Lundstrom's dance band. He later went to the west coast where
			he played with different groups in night clubs. Off &amp; on he played with Jim Keeble &amp; &quot;that's where
			I learned to cord &amp; got a lot of experience.&quot; Eldon went through a period when he didn't play at all for
			about 10-15 years. He got back to playing with a church group in Minneapolis. Upon returning to the Peever area
			he got aquainted with Leon Eneboe &amp; through him met Donny Backman. &quot;We used to get together at Big Coulee
			Store &amp; sit on a hay rack &amp; pick in the evening.&quot; At this point he got back into playing &amp; has
			been playing ever since. He played with Frank Keeble's Prairie Winds Band at sobriety dances &amp; also Dave Finstead
			&amp; God's Country. He has enjoyed his music partners and friends ever since.</FONT></TD>

			plastic strings from S&amp;H Green Stamps. The first song she learned was Wild Wood Flower. She came to our area
			from Campbellsville, Kentucky. She came out to visit her sister Shirley &amp; help with babysitting. She taught
			herself to pick guitar &amp; Franklin taught her how to cord later. She remembers picking at home in her bedroom
			&amp; her Mom encouraged her but said that her ears sometimes hurt with her plunking around. Juanitta says her
			Mom wondered if she would EVER learn to pick...But we all know SHE DID..!</FONT>&nbsp;<FONT SIZE="2"><BR>

			</FONT><FONT FACE="Andy">Frank first started playing guitar at age 15. He was taught to play by his Uncle Jim Keeble.
			Frank's first guitar was ordered from Montgomery Wards &amp; Jim taught him to play it. They picked at his house,
			he had a band, and Frank used to hang around and listen. He eventually started playing with them as rhythm guitar.
			About 1983 or so Frank started playing for sobriety dances and they were looking for band members &amp; that is
			how he met Eldon, Donny &amp; LaVern. They formed a group called Prairie Winds.</FONT></TD>

			the chords down on paper and that's how he learned. He first played at Old Cranks, Melvins Cafe, and on Wednesday
			nights he played at Lloyd's with Jim anderson from Eden, Duke Kurrasch &amp; Harold Amos. For about 10 years he
			played with the Country Scandinavians. He also played with Doc Larsens Red Suspender Band. Donny has always played
			for benefits around our community and area. It is no surprise that Donny, along with Leon Eneboe, Elden Lawrence,
			Frank Keeble &amp; Alex Jordan also volunteer their talent and time at the Salvation Army.</FONT> <BR>

		</TD>
		<TD WIDTH="64%">&nbsp;<FONT FACE="Andy">Roger Pearson got started with music at about age 6 up around the New Effington area. His
			Dad dropped him off for piano lessons on his way to the feed store. Stopping back to pick him up on his way home,
			the piano teacher told his Dad to &quot;save your money&quot; muses Roger. Well, Roger then picked it up at home
			with a kind of a &quot;family band&quot; with his mom, brothers &amp; sisters. At Sisseton School he was involved
			in chorus, rather than band, because he wanted to play a trumpet instead of a squeaky clairnet &amp; the band already
			had enough trumpets. He then started steel guitar at about age 14. &quot;Eddy Arnold used to come on at 6:30 AM
			with Steel Guitarist Roy Wiggins &amp; I thought it was the most beatuiful sound I ever heard &amp; I started steel
			guitar.&quot; Roger's inspiritation to get serious about music came from 4th grade teacher Helen Westby who also
			taught music. His brother had taken up accordian &amp; when his brother was not around Roger would pick up his
			accordian &amp; mess around with it &amp; that's how he learned to play the accordian. He also learned a few songs
			on the banjo. Roger played with the Harold Johnson band for about 20 years. He also played with the Tony Marpinek
			Band. His 1st instrument was a flat top guitar with a picture of Buck Jones &amp; his horse on it. After that he
			bought a pedal steel guitar &amp; hung the Buck Jones guitar in the garage where it got rusty. About 6 months later
			a lady called called and said &quot;I got a guitar at a pawn shop, could you tune it for me?&quot; &quot;It was
			my old Buck Jones guitar&quot; muses Roger.</FONT></TD>

			age 9 or so playing the button accordian &amp; harmonica. He then learned to play the piano accordian. As a youngster
			he played at barn dances around the Clinton area. He also learned to play guitar &amp; played lead guitar in a
			band for about 10 years. After that he started the dobro when he came to know the Lord. He enjoyed listening to
			the dobro musicians on the Grand Ole Oprey. Harold's whole family was involved with music &amp; had a bluegrass
			&amp; country band. He met Donny Backman at a barn revival in Clinton about 3 years ago &amp; had enjoyed playing
			music with him since that time. </FONT>&nbsp;</TD>
